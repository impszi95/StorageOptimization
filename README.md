# StorageOptimization
Customers shop online and post their orders at checkout. At the end of the
day the tool submit the totals of items ordered to the respective suppliers and factories who make the
goods that you sell. The factory ships the manufactured products in batches. When a batch of shipment
comes in the program decides which customer orders are ready to be shipped out.<br /><br />

The software optimizes the amount of stored goods. A customer order contains the list of ordered items
described with a name and the quantity. A factory shipment note contains the list of shipped items and
quantities. The result indicates which orders are to be served and which items need to be stored
until next shipment.
